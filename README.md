UCLA-Life-App
=============
An Android application that will behave as a simple and intuitive portal for UCLA students to access and manipulate information about their school
This includes but is not limited to;
1) A dining menu, and a restaurant hours option.
>The ability to "favorite" menu options and be notified when they appear again.
2) Access to class schedule, complete with rooms and map. (GPS?)
3) Any other cool shit I can come up with by mixing 20 sleepless hours, 4 lattes and the Marshall Mathers LP.
